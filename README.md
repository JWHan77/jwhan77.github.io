## About The Project

I've been working as a frontend web developer over 3 years. I built my personal portfolio website to showcase my frontend web development skills and wanted to make it look professional. So I used a laaqiqâ€™s design template and coded in HTML and CSS.

It is responsive on all devices and has smooth animations. Check out my website at [here](https://jwhan77.github.io/).

### Built with
