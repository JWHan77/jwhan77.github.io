## About The Project

I've been working as a frontend web developer over 3 years. I built my personal portfolio website to showcase technical skills. I turned laaqiqâ€™s public design template into code.

It is responsive on all devices and has smooth animations. Check out my website [here](https://jwhan77.github.io/).
